This task focused on building an AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Using Python and libraries like NLTK and spaCy, I developed a chatbot capable of:

Understanding user queries 🗣

Responding in a human-like way 💬

Learning from simple rule-based logic and text classification

🔍 This project helped me dive deeper into core NLP concepts and enhanced my skills in chatbot development, text preprocessing, and user interaction flow.
